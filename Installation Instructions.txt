Hello and thanks for downloading ! MESAplot is the replacement for MESAFace, the Mathematica-based plotting software we previously wrote. We currently consider it to be a beta version, although it is already quite useful. 

It would be helpful to get feedback on the installation process for various systems so we can properly deal with any troubles in the installation instructions. Please let us know: mwise@barry.edu or mgiannotti@barry.edu



MESAplot uses python 2.7 with the following (user-installed) libraries: wxPython, matplotlib, and numpy.

------======Windows======------
1) Install any python 2.7.x
	https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.7/

2) Install wxPython
	Visit http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#msw and get the appropriate installer.
	and follow instructions for the appropriate installer (typically wxPython3.0-win32-py27)

3) Install Numpy
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.7.2/
	and get numpy-1.8.1-win32-superpack-python2.7.exe

4) Install Matplotlib
	http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html
	and get the appropriate installer (typically matplotlib-1.3.1.win32-py2.7.exe) 
	
------======Mac======------
1) Install any python 2.7.x
	https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.7/

2) Install wxPython
	http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#osx
	and follow instructions for appropriate installer (you may have to change an OSX security & privacy setting
	to "Allow applications downloaded from: anywhere")

3) Install Numpy
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.7.2/
	and get numpy-1.7.2-py2.7-python.org-macosx10.6.dmg (other installers may cause installation difficulties)

4) Install Matplotlib -- 
	http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html
	and get matplotlib-1.3.1-py2.7-python.org-macosx10.6.dmg

------======Linux======------
1) Install any python 2.7.x . Many flavors now come with python. Don't forget to check your version (2.6 or 2.7).
	https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.7/

2) Install wxPython via a package repository. See the following links.
	http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#linux
	or http://wiki.wxpython.org/InstallingOnUbuntuOrDebian

3) Install Numpy
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.7.2/
	get the .tar.gz, build and install
4) Install Matplotlib
	http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html
	get the .tar.gz, build and install

--Please let us know ! mwise@barry.edu or mgiannotti@barry.edu

--Various versions of these libraries should work (of course, the package's python requirement is respected e.g. 2.6 or 2.7). We have not tested all versions.

--If python, Numpy, or Matplotlib give you trouble during installation, you may wish to install Anaconda, a scientific suite of python software (or some other suite). You will still need to install wxPython after this. Make sure you respect whether you use the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Anaconda when getting wxPython. 

--We are working on instructions for pip and other package managers.
